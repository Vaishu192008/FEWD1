    <h1>Frontend Development Course</h1>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The Front-End Web Development Laboratory course provides hands-on experience in building responsive and <br>
interactive web applications using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Students will learn to design structured web <br>
pages, apply styling and layout techniques, and implement client-side validations. The course introduces modern <br>
frameworks like Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS for responsive design and covers DOM manipulation, event handling, <br>
and API integration. Through practical experiments and mini-projects, learners develop problem-solving skills and <br>
creativity in web design. By the end of the lab, students will be able to design, validate, and deploy user-friendly <br>
front-end interfaces aligned with industry standards.</p>
